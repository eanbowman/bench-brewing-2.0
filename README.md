Step 1 – Install Node.js

Head on over to http://nodejs.org and click install – this should automagically figure out what OS and version.

Step 2 – Install Gulp.js

gulp-2x Open command prompt – (run cmd) then type ‘npm’ – if there is no  error you’ve installed Node.js correctly yay! Otherwise make sure you close and reopen command prompt if it was open during install. Or try rebooting – reinstalling, the usual.

Now type ‘npm install -g gulp’ this will install Gulp.js globally on your system. It will enable you to run the ‘gulp’ command in your command prompt.
